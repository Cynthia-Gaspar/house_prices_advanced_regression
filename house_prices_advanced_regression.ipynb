    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents our team's approach to the **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** Kaggle competition. The objective was to predict final sale prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa using a dataset of **79 explanatory variables** covering nearly every aspect of a property—from lot size and basement finish to porch type and neighborhood condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was completed as part of the **Predictive Analytics course**, a core component of the **Master of Management Analytics curriculum at Queen's University**. It represents a collaborative team effort to apply and compare advanced regression methods in a realistic, competition-style setting.\n",

    "## Competition Objective & Evaluation Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective:** Predict `SalePrice` for each property in the test set\n",
    "- **Metric:** Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) calculated on the **logarithm** of predicted values versus the **logarithm** of observed sales prices\n",
    "- **Rationale for log transformation:** Ensures prediction errors for expensive and modestly-priced properties contribute equally to the final score, mitigating scale-dependent bias\n",

    "\n",
    "### Categorical Features: Missing as Absence\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Numerical Features: Missing as Zero\n",
    "\n",
    "For square footage and count variables associated with absent features (e.g.,BsmtFinSF1, GarageArea, BsmtFullBath, GarageCars), missing values are set to zero. This maintains consistency with the categorical encoding of absence.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Logical Consistency Constraints\n",
    "We enforce domain logic: if `MasVnrType` is `\"None\"`, then `MasVnrArea` must be 0. This prevents houses without masonry veneer from receiving positive area values through imputation.\n",

    "This skewness is theoretically expected in housing markets: the majority of properties cluster within a modal price range, while a smaller number of luxury properties command substantially higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed skewness suggests that a log transformation may:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduce asymmetry in the error distribution\n",
    "2. Stabilize residual variance (mitigate heteroscedasticity)\n",
    "3. Align the modeling objective with the competition's evaluation metric\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization establishes the baseline distribution against which the effectiveness of subsequent transformations can be assessed."

    "## 7.1 Log-Transformed Target Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Following application of the natural logarithm transformation, we re-examine the distribution of `log_SalePrice` to assess the transformation's effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributional Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformed distribution exhibits substantially improved symmetry relative to the original scale. Key observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduced skewness** – The right tail has been compressed, bringing extreme values closer to the central tendency\n",
    "- **Approximate normality** – The density approximates a Gaussian distribution, though some deviation persists\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantitative Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The log transformation demonstrably reduces skewness while preserving the underlying price relationships. This transformed variable will serve as the modeling target for all subsequent regression procedures, ensuring direct optimization of the competition's evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodological Note\n",
    "\n",
    "All models will be estimated on `log_SalePrice`. Final predictions will be back-transformed via exponentiation (`np.exp()`) for submission, with the log transformation ensuring that prediction errors are evaluated on the scale specified by the competition."

    "| Component | Specification | Rationale |\n",
    "|-----------|---------------|-----------|\n",

    "### Design Matrix Construction\n",

    "\n",
    "### Feature Scaling Protocol\n",
    "Regularized regression methods (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet) are sensitive to predictor scale. Scaling is applied with deliberate discrimination:\n",
    "\n",
    "**-Continuous features** – Standardized to zero mean, unit variance\n",
    "\n",
    "**-Binary indicators** – Retained in original 0/1 encoding (scaling would alter interpretation)\n",
    "\n",
    "This targeted scaling preserves the interpretability of dummy variables while ensuring appropriate regularization of continuous predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A standardized reporting function computes and displays RMSE and R² for both training and validation partitions, enabling systematic comparison across model specifications.\n"

    "\n",
    "This investigation developed a weighted ensemble model for predicting residential property prices in Ames, Iowa, achieving a validation log-RMSE of **0.1275**. This means that, on average, the model's predictions deviate from actual sale prices by a factor of exp(0.1275) ≈ 1.136, or approximately 13.6% when expressed as multiplicative error on the original dollar scale. This represents a 3.0% improvement over the best individual model (Ridge: 0.1314) and demonstrates the effectiveness of the ensemble approach.\"\n",
